Pretty woman, walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you
You're not the truth
No one could look as good as you
Mercy!

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?
Rwar-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r

Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
